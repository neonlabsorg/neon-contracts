1. Currently it's not possible to burn a Solana user. Should we work to support burning as well?
2. We did upgrade the solidity version of erc20_for_spl.sol to latest one ( 0.8.28 ). Do you think this will somehow impact the bytecode upgrading?
3. !!! IMPORTANT !!! currently NEON_EVM_PROGRAM is hardcoded with the value of Neon EVM's program ID in the curvestand. When deploy to devnet & mainnet this value should be updated and tests to be re-run again. Ideally we would have included this variable to be set in the constructor, but the constructor won't be called again since we're upgrading, not re-deploying.
